It is API complete, but missing some of the helper objects I intend to create.\n\n## Usage\n\nnode-bitlyapi uses Bitly's OAuth implementation, so you'll need to register an OAuth application with them.\n[Register a Bitly OAuth app](https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps \"Bitly OAuth Apps\")\n\n\tvar BitlyAPI = require(\"node-bitlyapi\");\n\tvar Bitly = new BitlyAPI({\n\t\tclient_id: \"Something\",\n\t\tclient_secret: \"Something\"\t\n\t});\n\nYou can then either authenticate using your username and password\n\n\tBitly.authenticate(username, password, function(err, access_token) {\n\t\t// Returns an error if there was one, or an access_token if there wasn't \n\t});\n\nor if you know your OAuth access_token, you can simply call:\n\n\tBitly.setAccessToken(access_token);\n\n## The Bitly Object\n\nEach of the public Bitly API endpoints are mapped and available with the following method signature\n\n\tBitly.[method name](parameters, callback(error, response){\n\n\t});\n\nFor Example:\n\n\tBitly.shorten({longUrl:\"https://github.com/nkirby/node-bitlyapi\"}, function(err, results) {\n\t\t// Do something with your new, shorter url...\n\t});\n\nWhere parameters is a key-value object {} according to Bitly's API documentation. \n\nTo see the full mapping of the Bitly API, visit [The Wiki](https://github.com/nkirby/node-bitlyapi/wiki/The-Bitly-Object \"The Bitly Object Wiki\")\n\n## Helpers\n\nTo make navigating the Bitly API a bit easier, a handful of small wrapper objects & methods have been provided to make your life a bit easier. \n\n### Shortening\n\nSince the vast majority of Bitly's usage is through shortening, I've provided a simpler alternative to the standard Bitly.shorten mapping:\n\n\tBitly.shortenLink(\"https://github.com/nkirby/node-bitlyapi\", function(err, results) {\n\n\t});\n\n### Objects\n\nThe following objects are provided to wrap the API in a friendlier manner\n\n#### BitlyUser\n\t\n\tBitly.user()\n\tBitly.user('login')\n\tBitly.user('login').getLinkHistory(null, function(err, results) {\n\t\t// Gets the public link history of \"login\"\n\t});\n\nFor more information about a BitlyUser - [Wiki](https://github.com/nkirby/node-bitlyapi/wiki/BitlyUser \"BitlyUser\")\n\n#### BitlyLink\n\n\tBitly.link('http://bit.ly/1eOHYrA')\n\tBitly.link('http://bit.ly/1eOHYrA').getInfo(function(err, results) {\n\n\t});\n\nFor more information about a BitlyLink - Wiki\n\n#### BitlyBundle\n\n\tTo Do.\n\n#### BitlyBundleLink\n\n\tTo Do.\n\n## Credits & Such\n\nThis project was created by Nathaniel Kirby\n\n[nate@projectspong.com](mailto:nate@projectspong.com \"nate@projectspong.com\")\n\n[@thenatekirby](http://twitter.com/thenatekirby \"Nate Kirby on Twitter\")\n\nDespite being Bitly's iOS developer, this project doesn't mean that\n\n\ta) I know anything more or less about iOS because of it.\n\tb) Or, inversely, that I know more or less about JavaScript, CoffeeScript or whatever else script is coming up next.\n\tc) That Bitly approves, condones, supports or even acknowledge this project.\n\nFeel free to use this to make great NodeJS apps using Bitly's API. Your usage of their API is subject to their terms and conditions. Don't be a jackass, or a spammer...or a jackass spammer.\n\n### License\n\nThis software is provided via the MIT License.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
